# neovimconfig

This is my neovim config.
It has:

- LSP integration
- Completion from buffer, luasnip and nvim lsp

Completion is provided by `nvim-cmp`.
Mason is used to manage the LSP.

Completion is disabled when there's no LSP attached so you can write markdown or text files without any distractions.
